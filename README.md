## **Testing**
***

The [WebAIM Contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) has been used to test that the contrast between the colors used is sufficient. ------At first, the pink color didn´t pass one of the tests for normal sized text. I changed the color to a slightly brighter one, then all colors passed all tests.---------

The site has been tested so that it works on different browsers. It has been tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Samsung Internet. TESTAAAAAAAAAAA

I have confirmed that the links on the site are not broken and works as intended and that all text is readable.TESTAAAAAAAAAAA

I have used Responsinator and the DevTools toolbar to test responsiveness and make the site look good on different screen sizes.

Git was used for version control. Gitpod was used to write the code and the site was continuously preview using DevTools.
